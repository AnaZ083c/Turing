# Turing

This program simulates the Turing machine.\
\
It reads the lines of Turing codes from text file turingCode.txt and then tries to output the result through the console.

## How it works
Put your code into "turingCode.txt" file located in the Turing folder. The code should be written as shown below.\
turing code: 1323r --> state2, read, write, state2, direction\
input: 1345 --> start at index 4!!
